*Car Parking Simulation*

This project is a graphical simulation of a parking lot with animated car movements. It visualizes cars entering, parking, and exiting in real time, while also showing parking space availability and usage predictions. The system uses PyQt6 for the interface and supports dynamic updates for enhanced user interaction.
